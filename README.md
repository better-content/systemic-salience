# Systemic Salience

Systemic Salience is the deliberately thin Better Content integration layer for dynamic bodily state. Diet remains the owner of ordinary nutrient values and its native screen; Brewin' and Chewin', Thirst Was Taken, Cold Sweat, Epic Fight, and vanilla remain the owners of their mechanics. This mod supplies the state and compatibility hooks needed for superlinear nutrition, sugar loading and debt, inverted-U alcohol, and threshold interactions.

On the server, Systemic Salience also owns the authoritative hunger-versus-nutrition episode boundary. A full hunger bar with any ordinary Diet group below the configured ordinary threshold starts one persisted episode; a completed edible use that brings all six groups to that threshold after Diet's update ends it. When Better Content Threads is installed, those transitions are emitted through its public reflection API with one correlation token.

Each ordinary food group owns one behavioral identity: Proteins are Impact, Grains are Work,
Fruits are Mobility, Fats are Endurance, Vegetables are Robustness, and Dairy is Renewal.
Sugar expresses Tempo by amplifying and spending the state already built; Alcohol expresses
Control through its useful midpoint and independently rising impairment.

Opening Diet uses Diet's native screen and navigation. Systemic Salience no longer replaces that
screen or adds a separate metabolism panel; its gameplay effects and contextual feedback continue
to operate independently. Meal recaps use bright, wrapped food-group labels, retain the aspect
badge, and remain visible for four to ten seconds according to their size. Opening a screen
or hiding the HUD pauses their timer so the explanation is available when play resumes.

The eight identities use short physical-foley gestures with a quiet one-second room decay.
Nutrition, RPG allocation, and Matter use related contextual renders rather than identical
files. Sugar crash deliberately receives a broken Tempo gesture. The reproducible renderer,
checked-in CC0 excerpts, exact hashes, and source provenance live under `audio/` and `tools/`.

World owners can tune curve constants, half-lives, every nutrient threshold, and `item_id=load` alcohol profiles in `systemic_salience-server.toml`. Defaults remain the authored Better Content balance contract, so ordinary iteration does not require a mod rebuild.

It is not a global aspect registry and the other Better Content mods do not depend on it.
